PROJECT TITLE

"Gym Rat Deals" is a platform that allows gyms to make an account and offer exclusive discount codes at no cost to the user.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This is a "React-in-Rails" application which allows a Gym to create an account, add their gym in the form of a card to an index of other cards, edit/delete cards they have created, and list their promotions. Users are able to browse the application and view promotion codes on gym cards.

The current iteration of the app allows all users to be able to create an account and cards, however, the frontend sign up feature can be removed so that accounts can only be added in the backend by the developer. This would allow the app to be refocused on the business aspect where the app owner can offer gyms an account on the app to list their gym for a small fee. The exclusive deal code offered by the gym to the user provides valuable metrics to the gym on their "cost to acquire new customers".

Future planned features: 

	• User login to harvest user information
	
	• Impressions counter and clicked counter for gym cards
	
	• Health and fitness blog
	
	• Mailing list
